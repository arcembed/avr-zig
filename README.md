# avr_zig

`avr_zig` is a Zig library for bare-metal Arduino Uno projects on the ATmega328P.

The package is organized by layer:

- `src/mcu` contains MCU register definitions.
- `src/board` contains board-specific configuration such as the Uno clock.
- `src/hal` contains low-level peripheral access.
- `src/drivers` contains higher-level device drivers.
- `src/runtime` contains startup support used by applications and examples.

The root `build.zig` builds the library archive only. Upload, serial monitor, and objdump steps live in each example's `build.zig` so the examples double as standalone reference projects.

## Package usage

Add this repository as a dependency, make `avr_zig`'s runtime bootstrap the executable root module in your `build.zig`, and keep your application module focused on `main()` plus optional interrupt handlers.


```zig
const avr = @import("avr_zig");

pub fn main() void {
    // Application code here.
}
```

Timer-backed helpers such as `avr.hal.time.sleep()` automatically provide their default interrupt handlers. Advanced applications can still override `pub const interrupts.TIMER0_COMPA()` explicitly when they need custom Timer0 behavior.

See the example projects in `examples/` for complete build scripts, linker setup, and flashing commands.
