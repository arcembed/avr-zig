# avr_zig

`avr_zig` is a Zig library for bare-metal Arduino projects on AVR microcontrollers.

Supported boards in this repository:

- Arduino Uno on the ATmega328P
- Classic Arduino Nano on the ATmega328P
- Arduino Mega 2560 on the ATmega2560

The package is organized by layer:

- `src/mcu` contains MCU register definitions.
- `src/board` contains board-specific configuration such as board clocks.
- `src/hal` contains low-level peripheral access such as GPIO, ADC, I2C, PWM, SPI, time, and UART.
- `src/drivers` contains higher-level device drivers such as SSD1306, HD44780, 7-segment display helpers, a lightweight DHT11 sensor driver and more.
- `src/runtime` contains startup support used by applications and examples.

The root `build.zig` still builds the library archive by default, and the package can now also build downstream AVR firmware directly when consumers pass an application entrypoint through `b.dependency("avr_zig", ...)`.

## Package usage

Add this repository as a dependency, make `avr_zig`'s runtime bootstrap the executable root module in your `build.zig`, and keep your application module focused on `main()` plus optional interrupt handlers.


```zig
const avr = @import("avr_zig");

pub fn main() void {
    // Application code here.
}
```

Timer-backed helpers such as `avr.hal.time.sleep()` automatically provide their default interrupt handlers. Advanced applications can still override `pub const interrupts.TIMER0_COMPA()` explicitly when they need custom Timer0 behavior.

See the example projects in `examples/` for minimal wrapper `build.zig` files that consume the package-owned firmware flow.

Input handling is split between `avr.hal.gpio` for digital pins and `avr.hal.adc` for blocking 10-bit reads. The Uno target exposes `A0..A5`; the classic Nano target exposes `A0..A7` with `A6/A7` as analog-only pins; the Mega 2560 target exposes `A0..A15`. The repository examples include digital button input, analog input sampling, single-digit and 4-digit 7-segment displays, KY-038 analog and digital sound sensing, DHT11 sensor polling, MFRC522 RFID UID reads over SPI, and more.

## Board Selection

Build the library archive for a specific board with:

```sh
zig build check -Dboard=uno
zig build check -Dboard=nano
zig build check -Dboard=mega2560
```

Build a downstream application with the package-owned flow using a tiny `build.zig`:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn build(b: *std.Build) void {
    const board = b.option([]const u8, "board", "Target board") orelse "uno";
    const tty = b.option([]const u8, "tty", "Serial device");
    const upload_profile = b.option([]const u8, "upload_profile", "Upload profile") orelse "default";
    const optimize = b.option(std.builtin.OptimizeMode, "optimize", "Optimization mode") orelse .ReleaseSafe;

    const avr = if (tty) |serial_device|
        b.dependency("avr_zig", .{
            .app_root = b.path("src/main.zig"),
            .app_name = "my_app",
            .board = board,
            .tty = serial_device,
            .upload_profile = upload_profile,
            .optimize = optimize,
        })
    else
        b.dependency("avr_zig", .{
            .app_root = b.path("src/main.zig"),
            .app_name = "my_app",
            .board = board,
            .upload_profile = upload_profile,
            .optimize = optimize,
        });

    b.installArtifact(avr.artifact("my_app"));

    for (&[_][]const u8{ "upload", "objdump", "monitor" }) |step_name| {
        const child = avr.builder.top_level_steps.get(step_name) orelse @panic("missing avr_zig step");
        const step = b.step(step_name, child.description);
        step.dependOn(&child.step);
    }
}
```

Typical usage from your application directory:

```sh
zig build -Dboard=uno
zig build upload -Dboard=nano
zig build monitor -Dboard=mega2560 -Dtty=/dev/ttyACM0
```

The public API stays the same across all three targets. `avr.gpio.Pin` and `avr.adc.AnalogPin` are selected from the active compile target, so existing Uno applications keep compiling unchanged while Nano builds gain `A6/A7` analog inputs and Mega builds gain the larger Mega pin set.

Classic Nano support reuses the existing `ATmega328P` runtime and linker script. This target is for the classic 16 MHz Nano only; Nano Every, Nano 33 variants, and ESP32-based Nano boards are out of scope.

## Board Notes

- `avr.hal.uart` remains `UART0` on all supported boards in this first pass.
- Uno and classic Nano `SPI` use `D10..D13`; Mega 2560 `SPI` uses `D50..D53`.
- Uno and classic Nano `I2C` use `A4/A5`; Mega 2560 `I2C` uses `D20/D21`.
- `avr.hal.time` reserves `Timer0`, so Timer0-backed PWM outputs stay unavailable.
- `avr.hal.pwm` currently supports `D3`, `D9`, `D10`, and `D11` on the Uno and classic Nano.
- `avr.hal.pwm` on the Mega 2560 supports `D2`, `D3`, `D5`, `D6`, `D7`, `D8`, `D9`, `D10`, `D11`, `D12`, `D13`, `D44`, `D45`, and `D46`.
- The servo driver stays Timer1-based. The default servo example uses `D9` on the Uno and classic Nano, and `D11` on the Mega 2560.
- Classic Nano `A6` and `A7` are available through `avr.hal.adc` only; they are not part of `avr.gpio.Pin`.
- Firmware builds accept `-Dupload_profile=default` or `-Dupload_profile=nano_old_bootloader`. The old-bootloader option is only relevant to classic Nano boards that still use the older 57600 baud bootloader.
